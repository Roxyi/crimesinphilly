# Crimes in Philly

This is a web mapping interface displaying the crimes in Philly during the time period from 2015-01-01 to 2016-04-12.
The data source is https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/crime-incidents/resource/3e00a40d-8444-418c-b3a6-bef5524b90a2. 

There are three types of data visualization: Chorepleth, torque timeline, and nearest crimes.  

The website of the project is: [crimesinphilly.com](https:crimesinphilly.com)

Thank [Nathan Zimmerman](https://github.com/moradology) and [Jeff Frankl](https://github.com/jfrankl) for helping me on the code.
